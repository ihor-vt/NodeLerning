# Personal Test Task Repository for Hillel School's Node.js Course

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to showcasing test tasks from the Node.js course at Hillel School. This repository serves as my portfolio, demonstrating the application of knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. Each branch within this repository represents a separate test task, providing a clear and organized view of my progress and learning journey.

## Introduction

As a participant in the Node.js course at Hillel School, I've created this repository to document my learning progress, challenge myself with test tasks, and share my solutions. The variety of tasks available across different branches span from basic to advanced Node.js concepts, reflecting my growth as a backend developer.

## Getting Started

To explore the test tasks, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ihor-vt/NodeLerning.git
   ```

2. **Switch to a specific task branch**

   ```
   git checkout task-branch-name
   ```

   Replace `task-branch-name` with the name of the branch you wish to explore.

3. **Install dependencies (if applicable)**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application (if applicable)**

   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Exploring the Tasks

Each branch is named according to the test task it represents. To switch between tasks, use the `git checkout` command followed by the branch name. Detailed instructions and task descriptions can be found within the respective branches, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the objectives and implementations.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal portfolio, feedback and suggestions are always welcome. If you have any comments or ideas for improvement, feel free to reach out or create an issue.
